# Simon Says Game

A lightweight, browser‑based recreation of the classic **Simon Says** memory game built with vanilla **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

---

## ⭐️ Features

* **Four‑color board**—green, red, yellow, and blue squares that flash in sequence.
* **Infinite levels**—each round appends a new random color to the pattern.
* **Instant feedback**—tiles flash when the game shows a step *and* when you click.
* **Score & high‑score tracking**—see your current score and the session’s best.
* **Zero dependencies**—runs in any modern browser; no build step required.

## 🕹 How to Play

1. **Start** – Press any key to begin.
2. **Watch** – A tile flashes. Memorise the colour.
3. **Repeat** – Click the same tile.
4. **Advance** – The game adds one more random tile to the end of the sequence each level.
5. **Goal** – Keep repeating the full sequence for as long as you can without making a mistake.

When you mis‑click, the screen flashes red and your final score is displayed along with the session’s high score. Press any key to try again!
